                        <p class="about-text fs-5">After graduation, my choice was made in favor of Web Development, where I completely plunged headlong. I started with the basic things - HTML and CSS. I really liked making the layout of the pages - worked with mockups in Figma. Later, I mastered the skills of working with the Bootstrap framework for fast and adaptive layout. I am also improving my skills with JavaScript as well as libraries such as React and Jquery, and other stuff. In addition, I have work experience with small libraries - List.js and SweetAlert2.</p>
                        <p class="last-p about-text fs-5">I have a great desire to become a member of the IT family, where I will be useful and will be able to make a significant contribution to the common cause, where I will constantly develop myself and my skills and be an integral part of one whole mechanism.</p>

The layout is created based on a template that has worked with in Figma. In addition, to correct errors and basic inconsistencies in different browsers, the normalize.css was used, as well as to improve the behavior of the site slightly. Written in pure HTML and CSS (not friendly for displays with a width of less than 768px).</p>

Unlike the previous project, normalize.css was not involved here and the work was made without any template. To add more, for a fast and adaptive layout, the Bootstrap framework of the 4th version was used for the first time - the first practice in this area can be also attributed to the aim of this project. Mobile-friendly with simple design (minimum screen width 320px).</p>

Besides adding, deleting, and marking completed tasks from the list, the user is able to observe the time and date in real-time as well as motivational phrases that replace each other. Moreover, the local storage stores the data in the local memory of the browser. (Minimum screen width 350px).</p>

                        <h3 class="project-name">Sneakers Online Store</h3>
                        <p class="project-description fs-5">The online sneaker store was created by using pure JavaScript where modules and Parcel Bundler were involved. The main emphasis was placed on the correct functioning of the shopping cart with the right displaying between three pages, along with storing all changes by using session storage this time. Bootstrap 5 was chosen for the layout of adaptive content, where CSS played a small role to adjust some elements. The project is mobile-friendly (minimum screen width 350px).</p>

                        <p class="project-description fs-5">This recipe application, which was created entirely with the help of the React JS library, allows the user to save recipes for cooking without wasting time searching in the future. Besides adding new recipes and deleting existing ones, there is also the possibility of editing each recipe individually in live mode as well as the function of searching for the desired recipe among the list, and all these changes are saved in the browser by using local storage. Unfortunately, this app is not mobile-friendly.</p>
